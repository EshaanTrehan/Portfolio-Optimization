Welcome to the **Portfolio Optimization** project! This Python-based tool assists investors in optimizing their stock portfolios using historical data. By analyzing the performance of selected stocks over time, the tool offers insights into the best allocation strategy to maximize returns and minimize risk.

## üöÄ Features

- **Historical Data Retrieval**: Gathers historical adjusted close prices of selected stocks from Yahoo Finance.
- **Visual Analysis**: Graphically displays the adjusted closing price history of stocks in the portfolio.
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes daily simple returns, annual variance, and volatility of the portfolio.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Uses the `PyPortfolioOpt` library to optimize the portfolio based on the Sharpe ratio.
- **Discrete Allocation**: Suggests a specific allocation of stocks based on available portfolio value.
  
## üìÅ File Structure

- üìÑ `Python Portfolio Optimization.py`: The main script containing the logic for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and portfolio optimization.

## üîß Setup & Execution
